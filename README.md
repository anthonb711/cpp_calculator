# Overview
This project is a simple calculator application written in C++ using the Qt UI framework. The goal was to extend my understanding of C++ beyond console applications by exploring desktop application development and UI design.
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building an interactive, user-friendly interface and understanding how C++ integrates with UI frameworks like Qt.

# Development Environment
For this project, I used Qt Creator, a powerful IDE specifically designed for Qt and C++ development. The setup process was seamless, and the IDE provided excellent support for designing, building, and debugging the application.

I utilized the QtWidgets library, which offers a straightforward and robust API for creating and managing UI elements in C++. This library also facilitated the styling and design of the application's interface, making the process intuitive and efficient.

# Future Work
- Add support for more mathematical operations and implement order of operations.
- Display the full expression being calculated before showing the result.
- Introduce a sidebar to display the history of previous calculations.
